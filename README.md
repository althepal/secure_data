secure_data
===========

store data securely that is encrypted and decrypted in browser

To get this working, clone the repository and run python manage.py syncdb

That will get it fully working. You can run it in dev mode with manage.py runserver

If you want to use in production, you need to edit settings.py to set the STATIC_URL to whatever you will be using.
